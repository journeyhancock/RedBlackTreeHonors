This is a C++ implementation of a Red Black Tree.
A Red Black Tree is a self balancing binary search tree that obeys the following properties:
- Nodes are either red or black
- The root is black
- Every leaf node has two NIL children which are black
- If a node is red then its children are both black
- Every path from root to a NIL node passes through the same amount of black nodes
